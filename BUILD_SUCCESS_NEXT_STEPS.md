## 🔍 Issue Found & Fixed

**Problem:** Build logs said "No framework detected"

**What I did:**
1. Updated `project/vercel.json` to explicitly specify `"framework": "vite"`
2. Added proper rewrites for React routing
3. Added API proxy configuration
4. Pushed changes to GitHub

**Vercel will now:**
1. Auto-detect new changes
2. Rebuild with updated configuration
3. Deploy the improved version

## 🚀 What Happens Next

### **Step 1: Vercel Auto-Rebuilds (1-2 minutes)**
- GitHub detected changes
- Vercel triggered new build
- Using updated configuration

### **Step 2: Check Your Website**

**Your Vercel URL will be:**
```
https://project123-dhanush555dh.vercel.app
```

(Or check Vercel dashboard for exact URL)

### **Step 3: Test the Features**

When you visit, you should see:

✅ **KOSG Logo** at the top
✅ **Movies Tab** with:
   - Real TMDB movie posters
   - 21 mood buttons
   - 19 genre buttons
   - 🔥 Trending button
   - Pagination with page numbers

✅ **Music Tab** with:

## 📋 What I Changed

### **Updated `project/vercel.json`:**

Added:
```json
"framework": "vite"  // Tells Vercel to treat as Vite project
"trailingSlash": false  // Remove trailing slashes from URLs
```

Why: This helps Vercel properly understand your project structure and serve files correctly.
